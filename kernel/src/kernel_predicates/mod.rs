/// # Inverted expression semantics
///
/// Because inversion (`NOT` operator) has special semantics and can often be optimized away by
/// pushing it down, most methods take an `inverted` flag. That allows operations like [`Pred::Not`]
/// to simply evaluate their operand with a flipped `inverted` flag, and greatly simplifies the
/// implementations of most operators (other than those which have to directly implement NOT
/// semantics, which are unavoidably complex in that regard).
///
/// # Parameterized output type
///
/// The types involved in predicate evaluation are parameterized and implementation-specific. For
/// example, a [`DirectDataSkippingPredicateEvaluator`] directly evaluates the predicate (e.g. using
/// parquet footer stats) and returns boolean results, while
/// [`IndirectDataSkippingPredicateEvaluator`] instead transforms the input predicate to a data
/// skipping predicate that the engine can evaluated directly against Delta data skipping stats
/// during log replay. Although this approach is harder to read and reason about at first, the
/// majority of predicates can be implemented generically, which greatly reduces redundancy and
/// ensures that all flavors of predicate evaluation have the same semantics.
///
/// # NULL and error semantics
///
/// Literal NULL values almost always produce cascading changes in the predicate's structure, so we
/// represent them by `Option::None` rather than `Scalar::Null`. This allows e.g. `A < NULL` to be
/// rewritten as `NULL`, or `AND(NULL, FALSE)` to be rewritten as `FALSE`.
///
/// Almost all operations produce NULL output if any input is `NULL`. Any resolution failures also
/// produce NULL (such as missing columns or type mismatch between a column and the scalar it is
/// compared against). NULL-checking operations like `IS [NOT] NULL` and `DISTINCT` are special, and
/// rely on nullcount stats for their work (NULL/missing nullcount stats makes them output NULL).
///
/// For safety reasons, NULL-checking operations only accept literal and column inputs where
/// stats-based skipping is well-defined. If an arbitrary data skipping predicate evaluates to
/// NULL, there is no way to tell whether the original predicate really evaluated to NULL (safe to
/// use), or the data skipping version evaluated to NULL due to missing stats (very unsafe to use).
///
/// NOTE: The error-handling semantics of this trait's scalar-based predicate evaluation may differ
/// from those of the engine's predicate evaluation, because kernel predicates don't include the
/// necessary type information to reliably detect all type errors.
